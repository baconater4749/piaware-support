# WIRELESS NETWORK CONFIGURATION
#

# Should piaware use a wifi adaptor
# for network access? You will need to attach
# a supported USB wifi adaptor for this to work.

# change this to "yes" to enable wifi
wireless-network no

# Wifi SSID and password.
# This should be changed to match your wireless
# network SSID and, for networks that require
# a passphrase, the passphrase.
#
# If your SSID or password contains characters other than
# numbers and letters, such as the # character or whitespace,
# you should enclose the value in quotation marks. For example,
# “pass word” or “pass#word”.
#
# To include quotation marks (") in a quoted value, use \"
# To include a backslash (\) in a quoted value, use \\

#
# RECEIVER CONFIGURATION
#

# Type of ADS-B receiver to use with piaware.
# This is used when configuring dump1090-fa and piaware.
# Supported types are:
#
#  rtlsdr:    a USB-connected RTL2832U DVB-T dongle using librtlsdr/dump1090.
#  beast:     a USB-connected Mode-S Beast.
#  radarcape: a network-connected Radarcape.
#  other:     a network-connected receiver that produces Beast binary output. 
#  relay:     like "other", but will use a local relay so that only one
#             connection to the receiver is needed, and also forwards output
#             to the local dump1090 for map display.
#
receiver-type rtlsdr

# For a receiver type of 'rtlsdr', these control dongle settings
rtlsdr-device-index 0
rtlsdr-gain -10
rtlsdr-ppm 0

# For a receiver type of 'radarcape', radarcape-host should be set to
# the IP or hostname of the Radarcape
radarcape-host your-radarcape-hostname

# For a receiver type of 'other' or 'relay', receiver-host and receiver-port
# should set to the IP/hostname and port to connect to for data.
receiver-host your-receiver-hostname
receiver-port 30005


#
# OTHER CONFIGURATION
#

# Should automatic system updates (initiated by FlightAware) be allowed?
allow-auto-updates yes

# Should manual system updates (initiated by you from the website control
# panel) be allowed?
allow-manual-updates yes

# Should rfkill ("airplane mode") be set on all wireless/bluetooth
# devices on boot? This can reduce interference if you are using a Pi 3
# but not using wireless and the receiver is in close proximity to the Pi.
# For obvious reasons, this won't work if you are using a wireless network
# configuration.
rfkill no
